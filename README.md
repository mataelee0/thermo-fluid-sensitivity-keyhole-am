# thermo-fluid-sensitivity-keyhole-am
Repository containing code and data accompanying the paper "Thermo-Fluid Simulation-Based Sensitivity Analysis of Thermophysical Properties Affecting Keyhole Depth in Metal Additive Manufacturing".

This code is based on the OpenFOAM solver laserbeamFoam.
The original laserbeamFoam implementation is available at:
(https://github.com/laserbeamfoam/LaserbeamFoam.git)

This repository contains modified and extended versions of laserbeamFoam
developed for thermo-fluid simulations and sensitivity analysis of
keyhole depth in metal additive manufacturing.
